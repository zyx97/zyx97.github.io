Welcome!
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and a research assistant in FullStack Security Lab([FSSL](http://tristartom.github.io/members.html)) at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu/) since Fall 2021. I am honored to be advised by [Dr. Yuzhe (Richard) Tang](http://tristartom.github.io/). My research interests lie in Blockchain Security.

I received an M.S. in Computer & Information Science from [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu/) in 2020, and a B.S. in Software Engineering from [Hubei University](http://www.hubu.edu.cn) in 2019.

I am actively seeking **Summer 2024 internship** opportunities in roles such as **Software Development Engineer(SDE)** or **Developer/Security Analyst in Blockchain**. If there are any available positions, please feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:hizyx97@gmail.com).
